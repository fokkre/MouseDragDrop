# MouseDragDrop
This is to fix that issue with users where they "accidentally" move a folder or file. 
The most common issue is the motion of clicking a mouse causes it to move on the screen. 
Since the setting is in pixels it is hard for people without steady hands to not have this happen. 
Simple WinForms Application that allows you to set the number of pixels before a drag event happens.  
!! You must logout and back in for the setting to take effect.!!
Tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10
